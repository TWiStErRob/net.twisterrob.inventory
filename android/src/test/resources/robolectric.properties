# Robolectric 4.16 removed support for Android SDK 21 and 22.
# https://github.com/robolectric/robolectric/releases/tag/robolectric-4.16
# This project has minSdk = 21, so we need to manually force a different version.
# Historically this needed to follow minSdkVersion, otherwise weird Robolectric failures are triggered.
# Build.VERSION_CODES.M
sdk=23
