	<string name="about_license_libjpeg" tools:ignore="TypographyQuotes,TypographyOther"><b>Thanks to <a href="http://www.ijg.org/">Independent JPEG Group</a> for writing their <a href="http://www.ijg.org/files/jpegsrc.v9b.tar.gz">JPEG encoder implementation</a>, I used the <tt>rgb_ycc_convert</tt> function (translated into Java and heavily refactored) and related code to produce a high-quality well-compressed JPEG file. See my <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/36560663/253468">StackOverflow Q&amp;A</a> for technical details on why this was needed.</b>

		\n1. We don\'t promise that this software works. (But if you find any bugs, please let us know!)
		\n2. You can use this software for whatever you want. You don\'t have to pay us.
		\n3. You may not pretend that you wrote this software. If you use it in a program, you must acknowledge somewhere in your documentation that you\'ve used the IJG code.
		\n
		\nIn legalese:
		\n
		\nThe authors make NO WARRANTY or representation, either express or implied, with respect to this software, its quality, accuracy, merchantability, or fitness for a particular purpose.  This software is provided \"AS IS\", and you, its user, assume the entire risk as to its quality and accuracy.

		\nAll Rights Reserved except as specified below.
		\n
		\nPermission is hereby granted to use, copy, modify, and distribute this software (or portions thereof) for any purpose, without fee, subject to these conditions:
		\n (1) If any part of the source code for this software is distributed, then this README file must be included, with this copyright and no-warranty notice unaltered; and any additions, deletions, or changes to the original files must be clearly indicated in accompanying documentation.
		\n (2) If only executable code is distributed, then the accompanying documentation must state that \"this software is based in part on the work of the Independent JPEG Group\".
		\n (3) Permission for use of this software is granted only if the user accepts full responsibility for any undesirable consequences; the authors accept NO LIABILITY for damages of any kind.
		\n
		\nThese conditions apply to any software derived from or based on the IJG code, not just to the unmodified library.  If you use our work, you ought to acknowledge us.
		\n		
		\nPermission is NOT granted for the use of any IJG author\'s name or company name in advertising or publicity relating to this software or products derived from it.  This software may be referred to only as \"the Independent JPEG Group\'s software\".

		\nWe specifically permit and encourage the use of this software as the basis of commercial products, provided that all warranty or liability claims are assumed by the product vendor.

		\nThe Unix configuration script \"configure\" was produced with GNU Autoconf.
		\nIt is copyright by the Free Software Foundation but is freely distributable.
		\nThe same holds for its supporting scripts (config.guess, config.sub, ltmain.sh).  Another support script, install-sh, is copyright by X Consortium but is also freely distributable.
		\n
		\nThe IJG distribution formerly included code to read and write GIF files.
		\nTo avoid entanglement with the Unisys LZW patent (now expired), GIF reading support has been removed altogether, and the GIF writer has been simplified to produce "uncompressed GIFs". This technique does not use the LZW algorithm; the resulting GIF files are larger than usual, but are readable by all standard GIF decoders.
